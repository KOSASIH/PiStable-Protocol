# Governance Model

The governance model empowers the community to make decisions regarding the protocol's future. Key features include:

## 1. Proposal Creation
- Users can create proposals by providing a title and description.
- Proposals can cover protocol changes, new features, or funding requests.

## 2. Voting
- Users vote on proposals using their staked tokens.
- Each token represents one vote, allowing "Yes" or "No" votes.

## 3. Execution
- Proposals with majority votes are executed automatically by the governance contract.
- The execution process is transparent and recorded on the blockchain.

## 4. Community Engagement
- Regular community meetings and discussions encourage participation and feedback.
